# Contributing to Demeter.run

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Demeter.run. It's people like you that make Demeter.run such a great tool.

We welcome any type of contribution, not only code. You can help with:

- QA: file bug reports, the more details you can give the better (e.g. screenshots with the console open)
- Marketing: writing blog posts, how to's, printing stickers, ...
- Community: presenting the project at meetups, organizing a dedicated meetup for the local user group, ...
- UX: design the UI, create user-friendly and consistent experiences, ...
- Code: take a look at the open issues. Even if you can't write code, commenting on them, showing that you care about a given issue matters. It helps us triage them.

## Your First Contribution

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this free series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

## Submitting code

Any code change should be submitted as a pull request. The description should explain what the code does and give steps to execute it. The pull request should also contain tests.

## Code review process

The bigger the pull request, the longer it will take to review and merge. Try to break down large pull requests in smaller chunks that are easier to review and merge. It is also always helpful to have some context or background for the pull request, so please include this information in the PR description.

A pull request will be merged when:

- CI passes
- At least one core contributor gave the PR an approving review
- No core contributor objects

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

## Code, commit message and labeling conventions

We are following [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) for our commit message. When you commit with Commitizen, you'll be prompted to fill out any required commit fields at commit time. 

## Issue labeling

We use labels to classify issues, including:

- `bug`: something that is not working as expected
- `feature`: new functionality or requests
- `enhancement`: minor improvements of existing features
- `question`: more information is needed
- `documentation`: related to the documentation
- `good first issue`: good for first time contributors

Please make sure to use these labels as appropriate to help keep our issue backlog tidy and understandable.
